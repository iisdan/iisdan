My name is Dan Herbert ðŸ‘‹, and I'm a Full Stack Developer near Kitchener Ontario. My favourite things are gaming, movies and coding.
<br/><br/>
I've been fascinated with code all my life and began coding professionally in 2009 on web-based dental software. Over the years, I have built a diverse background working on full-time, freelance and personal projects. 
<br/><br/>
I've learned how to work in a blameless team environment, train new developers, share knowledge, accept and learn from failure, continuously integrate, and so much more. I'm inspired to see how I can evolve with technology and culture over the next decade.
